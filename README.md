This is the code used in the paper 
Deterministic Column Sampling for Low-Rank Matrix Approximation: Nystr√∂m vs. Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition, R. Patel, T. Goldstein, E.L. Dyer, et al., SIAM Data Mining Conference, 2016.

Specifically, this code implements:
oASIS in MATLAB, 
oASIS in MATLAB with mex, and
oASIS-P in C++. 

We also include a MATLAB function to generate BORG datasets.
